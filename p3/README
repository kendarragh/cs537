537make is a simple version of the linux make command. 
Here are the modules we used:
    parse.c is used to parse the makefile. The makefile can be specified
    or the default makefile. Parsing is done line by line, so we have
    incomplete knowledge while we parse and create nodes.

    node.c represents one node. Dependencies are first stored as strings,
    because we cannot differentiate between files and targets immediately.
    Later in graph.c we will convert these dependencies to separate files
    and children

    graph.c builds and traverses the graph. It also checks for cycles
    and will call execute to execute commands

    execute.c will execute one command at a time, waiting for it to complete
    and checking its error code.
