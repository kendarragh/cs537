My code seems okay if I block in main.c and make sure only one of reader, m1, m2 writer
    happens at a time, but this doesn't seem very parallel?

If we aren't supposed to block in main.c, do we block during input? if not why do weird
    things happen

Signalling that input is done, a few ideas?
    Why is global var bad?
    Var in queue that is set when we receive eof, combine with size?
    var in queue vs some sort of item in queue that signals its the last item (not null?)
    Seems easy enough for reader but what about q2 and q3?
